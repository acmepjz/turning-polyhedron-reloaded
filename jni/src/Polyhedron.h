	* * Shape:
	*   * cuboid (with size and custom shape)
	*   * a list of predefined regular polyhedra
	* * Movement:
	*   * rolling (e.g. boxes in Rolling Block Mazes/Bloxorz)
	*   * moving (e.g. boxes in Sokoban/PuzzleBoy)
	*   * rotating (e.g. rotating blocks in PuzzleBoy)
	* * Controller:
	*   * none (i.e. can only be pushed by player)
	*   * player (i.e. can only be controlled by player)
